List for our project ideas:

1. (Nick) - A door lock that is either remote activated via some button (take garage door openers for an example that hook up in your car), or
		A door lock that is fingerprint activated (To make the lock more oriented towards ease of use and person locked), 
		this is to negate the need for a key and fumbling about to open the door or even worse losing your key.

2. (Nick) - [Idea I had while driving] Those relfectors on the road on the ground in between lines, 
		make it to where they light up green (or whatever color suitible) on sensing liquid and 
		lack of lighting to make it easier to see during storms or dark nights on the interstate.

3. (Jeremy) Use the sound sensor from the previous class to make a collison detector. Would show how close to an object the sensor is with a GUI on the RPi as well as some LEDs to show how close to something it is (green means far away, yellow means getting close, red means imminent impact).

4. (Jeremy) Motion detection device. Detects if a person or object moves into the path of (either a laser or the sonic sensor) the sensor, and displays the distance from the sensor the object passed by.

5. (Dillan) A sensor that detects the BPM (displays it on a GUI) of a song and finds another song with same or similiar BPM (maybe display the name of the new song).

6. (Dillan) A text based adventure game.

7. (Dillan/Jeremy) Using radio transmitters and two RPi's, keep track of how many people use the main stairs in the IESB (both goin up and going down, it doent matter)
