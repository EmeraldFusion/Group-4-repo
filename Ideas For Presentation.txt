List for our project ideas:

1. (Nick) - A door lock that is either remote activated via an app on your phone, or
		A door lock that is fingerprint activated, this is to negate the need for a key and fumbling about to open the door or even worse losing your key.

2. (Nick) - [Idea I had while driving] Those relfectors on the road on the ground in between lines, 
		make it to where they light up on sensing liquid or lack of lighting.

3. (Jeremy) Use the sound sensor from the previous class to make a collison detector. Would most likely show how close to an object it is with a GUI on the RPi.
